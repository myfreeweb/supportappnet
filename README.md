# SupportApp for App.net

App.net-based support/feedback (inspired by services like Get Satisfaction).

Easy integrated feedback for ADN client developers â€“ just add a dialog that posts a reply with an annotation. Receive feedback in your Mentions stream, reply from your usual App.net client to comment. Easily see which suggestions are the most popular (votes = reposts).
